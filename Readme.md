# SSH-PI-Config

A simple GUI tool to enables SSH on PIs and then scans your local network for them. 

## NOTE 
I haven't tested writing to an actual device yet, but the IP search alone is worthwhile. 
We search the network for connected devices , and then filter to only include Raspberry PIs. 


Run it with python3  Config.py
